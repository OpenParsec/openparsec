1. INTRODUCTION
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To help in coordinating the Parsec open-source effort, this document
describes the most important tasks that need to be done in order to improve
the initial open-source Parsec release, and to create a truly enjoyable
gaming experience.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. TASKS FOR PROGRAMMERS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Interested programmers that want to help improve the Parsec code-base, should
pick tasks from this list first, to avoid a lack of focus and direction.
Please communicate with the other developers on the openparsec-devel mailing
list, if you decide to take on one of these tasks.

* Improve client/server code
  - redesign remote event interface
  - position interpolation between state snapshots of ships
  - exact laser positions according to time-delta to clients packet sendtime
  - stargate jumps must be initiated by the server
  - finish new clientside prediction model
  - determine which packets need to be send reliable
  - priorities for E_Distributables if exceeding bandwidth
  - first version should work with laser weapons only
  - get powerups to work completely
  - plausibility checks of player movements
  - add rocket weapon support 
  - after laser and rocket weapons work, get particle weapons to work
  - collision detection ship/ship must be done on the server
  - better collision response on ship/ship collisions
  - teleporters
  - packet/state compression when exceeding bandwidth constraints
  - get emp weapon to work
  - implement new serverside sim
  
* Player stats and federation handling
  - handover player stats when doing stargate-jumps inside of federation
    ( gameserver to gameserver communication )
  - introduce unique playerid

* Client/MacOS X: fix vertex-array rendering failure ( e.g.: teleporter, 
  vaportrail, emp )
  
* Server: split BOOT_SV.CON into several console scripts

* Server: console code should load data from the packages ( PSCDATA0.DAT )

* split E_REList in E_REList and G_REListWriter. the latter contains all 
  gamecode specific functions
  
* Win32: introduce precompiled headers to speedup compile times

* Linux/Client: check segfault when connecting to gameserver

* Linux/Client: check segfault in XQueryExtension()

* Win32/Server: check the memory leak we get in the server

* Win32/Server: check crash in CURSES.DLL when running from the IDE
  
* consolidate and check packetsize constants ( e.g.NET_MAX_DATA_LENGTH,
  NET_UDP_DATA_LENGHT, CurMaxDataLength, NET_ALLOC_DATA_LENGTH, 
  RECORD_PACKET_SIZE )
  
* Client: check whether the demo recording for PEER still works ( GMSV 
  does not have demo recording for now )

* time entries in UTL_LOGFILE should also give the correct date/time

* integrate old ( DEBUG.CPP ) and new ( UTL_MEMORYMANAGER.CPP ) memory 
  management. we need C++ equivalents for ALLOCMEM/FREEMEM for NEW/DELETE

* Server: get rid of the proxy variable access in CON_INT_SV. 
  directly modify the members of the global classes ( set/get functions )

* Server: autocompletion does not work in the console
  
* Add bots
  Preliminary bot interface is available. ( GM_BOT_CL.CPP )
  Server-side vs. client-side bots?
  Integration with networking code?
  
* Improve starmap
  Add more features, fix the existing problems.
  
* Improve planet code (clipping, culling, rendering, collision detection)
  Preliminary planet code with ring system support is available. Needs work
  in several areas. Needs changes in REND, needs LOD support.
  Needs proper integration with server (see starmap spawning code in server).

* Add proper visibility detection code for particle flares. Current method
  uses Z-Buffer reads, which is incredibly slow on some drivers/GPUs (e.g. 
  ATI drivers on OS X) or not working at all (Matrox drivers?).
  Use ray-casting as an alternative method.
  
  -or-
  
  Revamp ship propulsion effects completely, using more sophisticated iter
  drawing, and textures. Let go of particle effects?

* Add other objects that can exist in space (e.g. asteroid fields)
  Implementation should be done using custom objects.

* Rewrite AUD subsystem
  using FMOD or OpenAL it should be possible to use the same codebase on all
  platforms (-> licensing issues?)

* Add new music playback system. MP3 support is not available in open-source
  version. Add Ogg Vorbis support (-> interdependencies with AUD subsystem)

* Revamp VID subsystem to allow various additional resolutions (wide-screen)
  and improve FOV handling, and view parameters for projection (vid_supp.c)
  Make this more flexible. Avoid the need for code changes to support new
  resolutions.

* Add HID Manager joystick support for Mac OS X.

* Add audio CD support for Mac OS X (-> coordinate with AUD subsystem rewrite)

* Fix bugs in X11 that occur at startup when trying to grab the mouse cursor.

* Add Carbon Events support in Mac OS X version.

* Bring NULL subsystems up-to-date.

* Fix and improve launcher application on Win32 and Linux.

* Write a GUI frontend to allow placing of objects in world, e.g. stargates,
  teleporters, asteroid fields, etc.

* Enhance and improve tool chain. Add additional input object file formats
  to makeodt/BspLib. Automate process, add a GUI frontend.

* Implement a real scripting language for console scripts.
  Evaluate existing solutions (Python, JavaScript, etc.). Probably needs a
  big revamp of the console code, and lots of interfacing with game objects.
  Huge task!

* Implement big font support in Glide.
  Need to tile texture in 256x256 pixel chunks, draw using Glide primitives
  (iter code that is in place doesn't seem to work?).

3. TASKS FOR ARTISTS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. TASKS FOR OTHER INDIVIDUALS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Write generic game documentation

* Provide end-user support
  Write and maintain the FAQ, answer e-mail requests, update the news section
  of the webpage.
  
* Basically take over tasks that are currently handled by the developers.
